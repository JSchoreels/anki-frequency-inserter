## Usage

Have Anki running and the [AnkiConnect Addon](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) installed.<br><br>
**Just click 'Connect to AnkiConnect' (which won't do any changes yet)**, and accept the connection in Anki.<br>
This will show you which notes the script will update, after you **click 'Execute changes'**.

## Requirements
* [The Anki addon AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) needs to be installed (which should already be the case if you use Yomichan).
* Anki needs to be running.
* **Your notes need to have a field *FrequencyInnocent***<br>
If your notes don't have that field yet, you can add it in Anki via Tools -> Manage Note Types -> Fields.
  * You can change the field name if you're technically minded / can use the browser console:<br>
Go into the console and change `ankiInserter.ankiFrequencyFieldName`, and `ankiInserter.ankiSearchQuery` accordingly.<br>
You can also set `ankiInserter.ankiQueryAddition` e.g. to `Front:ÁßÅ` to limit what cards are updated (e.g. for testing).

## Disclaimer

This script should be very safe, it only updates the frequency field of notes (cards), if it already exists.<br>
**Still, even though this script is safe, please back up your Anki collection via File -> Export beforehand. It's good practice anyways.** Use the script at your own risk, i will not be responsible for changes to your Anki decks.

## Technical information
AnkiConnect API see [here](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect) or [here (in color)](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/).<br>
The only action this script uses that can change your cards/notes is `updateNoteFields` (technically, also `multi`, which here includes multiple `updateNoteFields` requests). And it only changes the field that's contained in the request, namely the frequency field.

Uses [InnocentCorpus](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/), a corpus of 5000+ books, which was bundled into a .js (~4.35MB) in `assets/js`.<br>
This means that the first visit of the website takes ~4.5MB of bandwidth.

If you want to run this locally, due to CORS, this only seems to work when hosted on a (local) server, e.g. with python3:<br>
`python -m http.server`<br>
Here, you may have to add `localhost:8000` to the `webCorsOriginList` in the AnkiConnect config,<br>
if `requestPermission` fails (happens on clicking 'Connect').
